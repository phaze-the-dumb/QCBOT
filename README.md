# KEEP THIS REPOSITORY SEMI PRIVATE!
It containes things like the Bot Key and admin commands that can be used to mess up the discord server.


To edit the bot and its commands you can use the dashbored (coming soon) or you can edit it locally and commit to the repository where me or R0ck will update the bot.
Please make sure to post in #staff-talk and #logs with a ping to a moderator when doing this for security reasons.
